%Given a seed and a probability distribution over SQs, returns a fitted SQ
%pcl is a point cloud
%seed is a point in pcl (may be empty, in which case select random seed)
%SQ is a starting SQ (may be empty, in which case sample from SQ_Pdist
%SQ_Pdist is a probability distribution on SQ params
function SQ = enzymeSQ_Creator( pcl, seed, SQ, SQ_Pdist )
