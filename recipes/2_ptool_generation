# Recipe for p-tool extraction

 Dependencies: Matlab
 Input: a folder with segmented point clouds
 Output: a file pTools.txt with the extracted pTools

1)  Follow recipe 1_segmentation

2)  Run the filtering matlab script segmentation/FilterAutoSegmentationByFreeSQFitting.m to filter out bad segmentations (this is based on the idea that good segmentations correspond to segments being "geon-like" (good superquadric fit score))

3)  Run enzymes/pTools/getPToolsFromFolder.m to generate a file with one p-tool for every possible usage of the pointcloud for a given task
