# Recipe for segmenting a set of pointclouds
 
 Dependencies: Matlab, PCL Llibrary
 Input: a folder with point clouds
 Output: n-folders with the segmented pointclouds (where n is the number of chosen cores to use in the machine)

PCL library: you will need to install the pcl library 
	1) Run enzymes/scripts/compile_pcl_lib.sh to compile the PCL library from source (this will take a while and install a lot of subdependencies)
		1.1) It will compile it in your home directory
	2) If it doesn't work, check the website: https://larrylisky.com/2014/03/03/installing-pcl-on-ubuntu/ (I based my script entirely on this website - and I'm very thankful for it)

1) Copy the file
	enzymes/segmentation/example_cpc_segmentation.cpp
	to
	~/pcl/examples/segmentation/example_cpc_segmentation.cpp
	(you will overwrite the original cpp file with mine that contains the brute-force segmentation code)

2) Recompile the pcl library
	2.1) Go to ~/pcl/release/
	2.2) Run: sudo make -j 4 install (I recommend the '-j 4' to use your 4 cores to compile faster)

3) Run: bash enzymes/script/auto_segmentation_mult_core.sh N_CORES PCL_FOLDER -fast (where N_CORES is the number of cores you want to use to run the segmentation in parallel; PCL_FOLDER is the folder containing all your point clouds; and '-fast' is recommended to run the segmentation in a reasonable amount of time)
	3.1) Example run: bash enzymes/script/auto_segmentation_mult_core.sh 4 ~/my_pcl_dataset/ -fast
	3.2) This will create N_CORES folders under PCL_FOLDER named 'autosegmentation_core_N', each with a subset from partitioning the pcls in PCL_FOLDER)
		Obs: You should get a lot of outputs detailing the segmentation each core is doing and the percentage completed
	3.3) The segmented pcls will be in the .pcd format

4) Convert the .pcd pcls to .ply by running enzymes/pcd2ply_mult.m
