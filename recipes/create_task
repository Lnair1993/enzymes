# Recipe for creating a new task

# In order to add a task for pTool generation :

1) Modify getTaskOrientationParams(task) in order to give the good orientation vectors used in rotateSQs function

2) modify getToolPosition used in pToolVec2Sim to get the right tool positioning during simulation in Gazebo.
