Hi Paulo,

Just in case you forgot the points, I just resend

(I just thought you might have forgotten because yesterday you said only orientation)

 

Is it a lot of work?

Need to pull in myself/chaozheng?

Hi,

 

As far as I know here is what is required from the vision side.

-The end point of the tool (e.g. spoon or spatula, the end point that will penetrate the grains first)

-A point at the back of the tool head, before it becomes the handle (i.e. the part of knife that will contact the edge first, for scraping along)

-The orientation of the tool in relation to the PCA'ed point cloud

-The middle of the handle (Chaozheng will probably put the grasp sphere here)

 

Is that everything?
